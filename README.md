# TW_Density_AFS
Final repo for Annals of Forest Science submission

Data used in the analysis can be found in "AnalysisReadyData" folder- other data folders can be ignored.

If you want to follow the scripts I used, the two most important are 

1) "TW_Density_Profile_Analysis.R", which uses a dataframe consisting of annual ring summaries to conduct the analyses, and
2) "Densitometry_Processing_AFS.R", which takes raw QMS files and compiles them into the dataframe used above.

All othe scripts/data can probably be ignored unless you are really curious.
